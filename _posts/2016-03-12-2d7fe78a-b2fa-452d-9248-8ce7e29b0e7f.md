There is an unprecedented emphasis on data in nearly all fields, including journalism.

When analyzing large data sets, researchers are always looking for ways to break the data down. However, there are only a few facets available to easily organize this data: race, gender, age, etc. Nothing about the life experiences of the individual, nothing about their likes or dislikes, nothing about their friendships or family situation...those things are too complex, and they are hard to fit into a single database column. So we stick with the things that are easy to categorize, giving them more importance than they actually deserve.
\* By breaking things down by race, you are actually promoting racism, suggesting there is a fundamental difference between the races.
