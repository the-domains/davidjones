A few years ago. In my group, there was a guy from India, a girl from Italy. Why are we still talking about this?

Most things get better as you talk about them. Racism isn't one of them. Every time we talk about race, we breathe life into the idea that it matters. another breath into it  this even a question on this form. I'm reminded of Trevor Noah's [hilarious account][0] of how he had to _choose_ his race when opening his first U.S. bank account. Coming from post-apartheid South Africa, where questions about race rarely appear on forms, Noah, who has a black mother and a white father, found himself debating with himself about whether to choose _black_ or _white_.

* * There is an unprecedented emphasis on data in nearly all fields, including journalism. When analyzing large data sets, researchers are always looking for ways to break the data down. However, there are only a few facets available to organize data: race, gender, age, etc. Nothing about the life experiences of the individual, nothing about their likes or dislikes, nothing about their friendships or family situation...those things are too complex. They are hard to organize and categorize. So we stick with the things that are easy to categorize, giving them more importance than they actually deserve.
* By breaking things down by race, you are actually promoting racism, suggesting there is a fundamental difference between the races.
